        <h2>Early life: </h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in San Antonio , Texas. I am the oldest of 3 and grew up on the Southside of town. Living in poverty, I was exposed very early on in life to drugs, violence, and deliquency by my classmates/peers. Most people from my side of town did not care 
          for school or felt that they weren't worthy of any type of higher education. Thankfully , this was not the case for me. My parents did their absolute best to keep me on the right track and made sure I 
          had goals and aspirations beyond grade school. They never gave up on me and I am forever grateful to be given the opportunity to continue pursing my education. </p>
